YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function that retrieves instances and their respective regions, while skipping instances that start with the specified prefix "FILLER". 

--- 2 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function that retrieves all module names from the current design and returns them as a list. 

--- 3 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function that gathers all instance pins with a rising arrival time greater than 0.5 seconds and returns them as a list. 

--- 4 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function that retrieves the capacitance coupling adjust factors for each net in the design and returns them as a list. 

--- 5 ---
NO, the script does not correctly implement the prompt. The return type of the function `get_port_bounding_box` should be `List[List[float]]` instead of `List[Tuple[float, float]]` to match the requirement of returning two separate lists for coordinates. 

--- 6 ---
NO, the script does not correctly implement the prompt because the `calibrate_net_cc` function is called without passing the required arguments for `net_name` and `factor`. It should be called as `calibrate_net_cc("req_msg[11]", 2.0)`. 

--- 7 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function that retrieves all nets in the design block that are wild-connected, using the `isWildConnected()` method. 

--- 8 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt. It defines a function that checks if any net in the design block has an altered wire by using the `isWireAltered()` method, and it returns `True` if any such net is found, which aligns with the requirements. 

--- 9 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt. It defines a function that retrieves the area parameter for each technology layer and returns a dictionary with layer names as keys and their corresponding area values. 

--- 10 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function `get_cc_segments()` that retrieves all capacitor-coupled segments from the current design block using the method `getCCSegs()`. 

--- 11 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function that sets the corner avoidance parameter for the IO pin placer and returns the vertical thickness multiplier. 

--- 12 ---
NO, the script only inverts the rotation of the instances but does not change their location. To fully implement the prompt, the script should also modify the location of the instances. 

--- 13 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt. It retrieves the forbidden spacing rules for the technology layer named 'via8' by using the appropriate methods from the OpenROAD API. 

--- 14 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt. It collects the design block pins objects of ports and constructs a dictionary with the port names as keys and their corresponding pins as values. The use of `getBTerms()` to retrieve the ports and `getBPins()` to get the pins is appropriate for the task. 

--- 15 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt. It retrieves the minimum cut rules for the technology layer named 'metal1' using the appropriate methods from the OpenROAD API. 

--- 16 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function that retrieves the total number of vias from the technology and prints the result. 

--- 17 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function that retrieves all resistor segments from the current design block using the appropriate methods from the OpenROAD API. 

--- 18 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function `get_clearance_measure()` that retrieves the clearance measure from the technology associated with the design. The function is then invoked, and the result is printed, fulfilling the requirement to "get the measure system." 

--- 19 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by setting the location of the instance named 'input2' to the specified coordinates (22500, 33459) after confirming that the instance exists. 

--- 20 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by setting the rotation of the instance '_411_' to 'MX' using the appropriate methods to get and set the transformation of the instance. 

--- 21 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function `reset_tapcell()` that retrieves the tapcell from the design and calls the `reset()` method on it. 

--- 22 ---
NO, the script does not correctly implement the prompt. The function `get_db_units_per_micron()` is intended to return the number of database units per micron, but it does not convert 1 um to the corresponding units used in the technology. Instead, it simply retrieves the database units per micron without performing any conversion or calculation related to the value of 1 um. 

--- 23 ---
NO, the script does not correctly implement the prompt because it does not include a function or code to get the count of the manufacturing grid, which is part of the requirements. 

--- 24 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function that retrieves all via definitions from the technology using the appropriate methods from the OpenROAD API. 

--- 25 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function `get_instance_names` that retrieves and returns a list of all instance names in the design block. The main function also handles command-line arguments and verifies the existence of the necessary files before calling the setup and instance retrieval functions. 

--- 26 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function to retrieve the number of database units per micron for the current technology and includes the necessary setup and argument parsing to execute this functionality. 

--- 27 ---
YES, the script correctly implements the prompt by defining a function to retrieve the clearance measure from the technology and printing it.
